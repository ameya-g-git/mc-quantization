# mc-quantization

A study I did on the [median cut colour quantization algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_cut), allowing me to mathematically prove the algorithm's **O(n) time complexity** and demonstrating the drawbacks of the algorithm through a heat map of SSIM values, indicating poor results in high-contrast, high-detail areas of the inputted image


# How to use

I've designed this project as to make it as easy as possible to play with your own images and collect your own data! Let's go through a quick overview of what each program does, and then we'll cover how to configurate them to your own desires!

`mcquantizer_full.py`: The crux of this project, the actual colour quantizer itself. It takes in an image, the number of iterations you want to quantize to, and the number of trials of data to collect. It saves the quantized images and the .csv file with all of the collected data within a directory with the same name as the source image. In addition, the quantized images follow a naming convention of `{input file name}_quantized_{number of iterations}.png`, making it easy to find different versions of your source image (ignore the naming convention of the sample files I tried the algorithm on, those were back when I barely understood the topic I was studying ðŸ˜­).

`rgbplot.py`: This one is honestly my favourite, it takes in an input image, and uses the matplotlib Python package to plot the image's colour data for each pixel such that (x, y, z) = (R, G, B). It's often very funny to see an image of your pet turn into a blob of coloured particles, so play around with this!

`ssim_heatmap.py`: This one takes in a directory of your quantized images (as generated from `mcquantizer_full.py`) and generates SSIM heatmaps by comparing your source unquantized image to the quantized image generated from the algorithm, iterating through every quantized image in the directory (make sure you don't change the name of the files in the directory so this works correctly!). In case you don't know what SSIM is, find more information [here!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity_index_measure)

# Configuration

Now, we get to the best part, configurating this project to your own files! To make the setup as easy as possible, I've created a `settings.py` file that essentially controls global variables across the 3 main programs. One thing to note is that your images should be in PNG format, as formats without an alpha channel tend to throw errors in all of the programs. Let's go through each of the parameters!

`input_file`: The name of the input file, no extension at the end.

`input_path`: The path that will take you to the image specified earlier. Change this depending on your folder structure.

`output_path`: The full path and name that the quantized images will be stored as. Make sure that the directory that you're storing the images in exists, or the programs will not work.

`csv_file`: The full path name of the csv file that the data will be stored in. Make sure to end this string with `.csv`. 

`iterations`: How many iterations of the algorithm you want to undergo. The algorithm will go through the range of values until iterations, running median cut that many times.

`trials`: Only necessary for data collection, set this to however many trials you want the algorithm to undergo.

Have fun!
